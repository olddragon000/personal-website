All three users found the app well-organized,\n                        well-planned, and user friendly. They liked the\n                        simplicity of the design and commented about how it was\n                        easy to navigate through the information presented to\n                        them in the home screen. As for negative feed, some\n                        users did not like the layout of the home page.
