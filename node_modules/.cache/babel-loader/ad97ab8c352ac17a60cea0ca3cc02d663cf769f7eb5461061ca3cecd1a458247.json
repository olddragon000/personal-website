All three users were able to complete the task successfully and gave the task a rating of 5 which represented very easy. In the video it seemed that the interactive elements were intuitively placed.

Even though she struggled a little bit, in the audio recording she described the process as “simple” and “straightforward”. User two was able to find the stretching expert directly and said that everything was “where they were supposed to be”. User three was expecting the stretching expert to be located in a different subcategory because she didn’t see the labels of the specialty fields we had put under the name of the experts. She was still able to complete the task fairly quickly and the fact that she struggled in the beginning didn’t bother her too much. We were expecting some users to struggle in this process because of the missing functionality that wasn’t relevant to the task but in general users did well.

The home page already provided a one click access to Amy’s messages so users did not struggle with understanding that a session was currently being held. Our expectations matched the users’ inputs with all of them succeeding with the task; however, one small behavior that did not match our expectation was how two of the three users did not check the messages tab to text Amy. This was not a problem as there were two routes to take to succeed in this task: checking the messages tab or going to Amy’s chat directly through the home page. Since both routes resulted in the task being completed, the fact that most of our users went with the second route surprised us a little, but it did not affect their success.\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography variant={\"body1\"}>\n                        <b>\n                            Post-test Question 1: What did you like and dislike about the prototype?\n                        </b>\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography variant={\"body1\"}>\n                        All users spoke on the aesthetic design of the app, calling it “appealing and attractive” and “easy to look at”. All three users found the app well-organized, well-planned, and user friendly. They liked the simplicity of the design and commented about how it was easy to navigate through the information presented to them in the home screen. As for negative feed, some users did not like the layout of the home page. They stated that the amount of information proved to be “a little overwhelming.” One other also stated that they would like a video option to call the influencer instead of conversing over text. Overall, comments during the video call were positive and we iterated upon our previous design to address these concerns.\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography variant={\"body1\"}>\n                        <b>Task 2: Imagine you hurt your hips and the pain has been bugging you for weeks.
